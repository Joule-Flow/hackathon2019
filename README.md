# hackathon2019
## participants of team outlink
- Vanessa
- Julia
- Alexs
- Camilo
- Julian

## git project goal
- give a peek into coding standards and the think process.
- fun to connect with others (think Outlinker ;) )
- get feedback of own work process, code quality and insight into other possible solution strategies.

## limitations
- due to the tight time box, there are still some open points and improvements to the code (structure, naming, completeness)
    - entity relations & data
    - usage of repositories with use case based methods

## additional information
we included also binary project files to give a thorough documentation.

## feedback
We had a great time and are looking forward to an annual hackathon in Fulda.

Thanks you!
